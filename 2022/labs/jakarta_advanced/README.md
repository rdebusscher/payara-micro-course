# Jakarta EE Lab (Advanced)

We will make a small shop kind of application where we can associate products with a user.  Some features

- Adding and removing products for the user requires 'authentication'.
- Some business rules apply, like at maximum 2 bikes, and 1 for other product categories.
- 2 different payment options.

Within the `commands.txt` file, the Curl commands are listed that should work against your implementation (or indicate if they should fail.)

The repository contains already some classes so that not all need to be implemented from scratch
https://github.com/rdebusscher/payara-micro-course/labs/jakarta_advanced.

The `solution` branch contains a possible solution for this lab.

Things that are expected to be used in this lab.

- Define JAX-RS resource classes
- Define JAX-RS resource classes
- Using different HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE)
- Using `List<String>` for a list of Parameters
- Validation of parameters (at JAX-RS level and business level)
- Injection of CDI beans.
- Use of `ContainerRequestFilter`
- Use of `Instance<T>`
